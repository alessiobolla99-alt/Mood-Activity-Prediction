## Mainly activities

### 1. Code Development
- **Debugging assistance:** Used AI to identify and fix bugs in the pipeline
- **Code optimization:** Received suggestions for improving pandas operations efficiency and general operation

### 2. Documentation
- **README structure:** AI assisted in organizing the README.md structure
- **Report proofreading:** AI helped review English grammar and clarity in the project report

### 3. Research & Learning
- **Feature engineering ideas:** Discussed approaches for cyclical encoding of temporal features
- **Best practices:** Consulted AI for temporal validation strategies in time series classification
- **Library usage:** Asked for guidance on SHAP library implementation

## Validation Process

All AI-generated code and suggestions were:

1. **Reviewed** for correctness and appropriateness
2. **Tested** to ensure proper functionality
3. **Modified** when necessary to fit project requirements
4. **Understood** before integration into the codebase

The most important thing has always been emphasized: CRITICAL THINKING.
